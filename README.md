Learning to implement decision tree models is important because they are simple yet powerful tools for classification and regression tasks. Decision trees provide a clear visualization of decision-making processes, making them a valuable educational resource for understanding the basics of machine learning algorithms and feature importance.

Usage

**Prepare the Data**

Ensure the Titanic dataset (titanic.csv) is in the project directory. If not, download it from Kaggle and place it in the directory.

**Run the Model**

Execute the script to train and evaluate the decision tree model.

python decision_tree.py

**View Results**

The script will output the model's performance metrics and visualizations.

**Results**

The model's performance metrics will include accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix. Visualizations such as the decision tree structure and feature importance will also be generated.
